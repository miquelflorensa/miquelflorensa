# Modules

pyTAGI already has some modules implemented. These modules enables user to create a model, load data, and perform different tasks such as regression, classification, and so on. The following modules are available:

- [**Models**](modules/models.md): This module contains the classes that define the models that can be used with pyTAGI.
- [**Data loader**](modules/data-loader.md): Set of classes that can be used to load data.
- [**Regression**](modules/regression.md): This module contains the classes that perform regression tasks.
- [**Classification**](modules/classification.md): This module contains the classes that perform classification tasks.
- [**Time series Forecaster**](modules/time-series-forecaster.md): This module contains the classes that perform time series forecasting tasks.
- [**Autoencoder**](modules/autoencoder.md): This module contains the classes that perform autoencoder tasks.
